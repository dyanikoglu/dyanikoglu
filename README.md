## Howdy ðŸ¤ 

Hi, I'm DoÄŸa. I've studied computer science at TOBB University of Economics & Technology, and currently working as Animation Engineer at GOALS. I've been working with Unreal Engine since 2015, and counting..

For my Unreal Engine related work, you can access my [Unreal Engine fork](https://github.com/dyanikoglu/UnrealEngine) with various bug fix & improvement branches including custom PhysX 4.1 / Nvidia Blast implementation. Please refer to [Unreal Engine Pull Requests](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adyanikoglu) for my PRs on Unreal Engine. You can also find bunch of other toy projects on the pinned repositories section below.

Lastly, you can follow [Project Borealis](https://projectborealis.com) to stay updated about the Half-Life 2: Episode 3 project I've contributed for a while. Also check out my work on an UnrealGameSync alternative [PBSync](https://github.com/ProjectBorealis/PBSync), designed for Git LFS and actively used by the development team.
